# JavaScript-Daily-Challenge
Weekly Custom Code Challenge just to help brush up on my coding skills and have fun while doing it.

Thanks for checking out my code. 

Edit 3/20: I was able to get the code finanly running there will be a screenshot uploaded to point all the mistakes, I will add on more to the Javascript Code by the end of the week (the deadline for this challenge to finish) as well.
