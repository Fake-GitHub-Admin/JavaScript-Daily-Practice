# JavaScript-Daily-Challenge
Weekly Custom Code Challenge just to help brush up on my coding skills and have fun while doing it.

Thanks for checking out my code. 

Edit 3/20: I was able to get the code finanly running there will be a screenshot uploaded to point all the mistakes, I will add on more to the Javascript Code by the end of the week (the deadline: 3/26 for this challenge to finish) as well. 

Edit 3/21: All about add ons to my current code, patched up the if statement conditional reaction as well as tunning up a bit the conditions

Edit 3/22: added Gender information for each subject, still looking for a solution to that list problem in the last console 

Edit 3/23: Code as a whole looks a bit more completed, added in empty arrays to store violators vs non violators as well as few other things hidded with /*
Side Note: I took out that for ( var key in obj), I forgot that the parameter is automatically going to go into that defined parameter in the console method search through for the appropiate key and print out the appropiate value. 

Code: "console.log(OriginallistOfPeople({Name: "Jefferson Bruke Jr", YesOrNoForCriminal:"N", Gender: 'Male'},{Name: "Jodi Alba", YesOrNoForCriminal: "N", Gender: 'Male'}));" 

The function is not getting to Jodi Alba's information I need to figure out what is causing this, I already switched the returns (known to immediately exit a certain action usually for loops), to console.log() located at the if and else statments - Asking for advice from good friends of mine. 




3/26: Last day of this Challenge
